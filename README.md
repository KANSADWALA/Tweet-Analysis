# Tweet-Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of 1.6 million tweets to extract meaningful insights through various analyses. The key objective is to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets and explore trends over time, user activity, and other metrics that can help understand the dynamics of the data. Advanced natural language processing techniques, along with data visualization, are employed to achieve this.

## Features

<ul>
  <li><b>Sentiment Analysis:</b> Categorizes tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.</li>
  
  <li><b>Sentiment Trends Over Time:</b> Analyzes how sentiments evolve over a specific period.</li>
  
  <li><b>Tweet Volume Patterns:</b> Explores tweet volume across different time frames to identify peaks and patterns.</li>
  
  <li><b>Tweet Activity Over Time:</b> Tracks the activity levels of tweets over time, helping to identify trends in user engagement.
</li>

  <li><b>Total User Count:</b> Provides the total number of unique users in the dataset.</li>
  
  <li><b>Top 10 Most Active Users:</b> Identifies and lists the top 10 users with the highest tweet counts.</li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used

<ul>
  <li><b>Python:</b> The primary programming language used for data analysis and processing.</li>
  
  <li><b>Pandas:</b> Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
  
  <li><b>Matplotlib & Seaborn:</b> Employed for data visualization.</li>
  
  <li><b>NLTK:</b> Natural language processing.</li>
  
  <li><b>Transformers (Hugging Face):</b> Used the roBERTa model for sentiment analysis.</li>
  
  <li><b>Jupyter Notebook:</b> Used for experimentation and development.</li>
</ul>






## Getting Started

## Project Structure

## Challenges and Solutions

<b>Time Complexity in Sentiment Analysis:</b> The sentiment analysis using the roBERTa model was time-consuming due to the large dataset. This was addressed by optimizing the data pipeline and using batch processing.
